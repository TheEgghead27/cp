min level for a cave
(highest power level) - (index to account for gains) + 1

k[0] + 1 to beat k[0]

we take the max needed entry level for a cave

a[j] + 1 - j
|req lvl|gains| = entry req

we list out all the entry levels, can permutate (sort) however because any order allowed

clearing cave i will award ki levels

we want to start on the lowest starting level, sort it first

also subtract the total monsters before it
then use the max to find the initial power

W[i] represents ith cave, [starting level, levels gained/monster count]

search for max (starting level - gains)
(init min_lvl to 0)

optimal to start with the minimum starting level
